/**
 * The Learning Strategy class is a single strategy to navigate around a NKFL.
 * 
 * The strategy is represented as an array of integers, and each integer corresponds to a single step in a
 * strategy.  Ex: strategyArray [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] will first take three steps of strategy zero, then
 * three steps of strategy 1, then another one step of strategy zero.
 * 
 * Strategies:
 * 0 = random walk
 * 1 = steepest climb
 * 
 * The Learning Strategy currently is capable of only 
 * random walking or steepest climbing.  This is to attempt
 * to reproduce the results in Dr. Yoder's original code.  The code can easily be expanded to accommodate
 * additional possible strategies (such as doing nothing or non-steepest climbing)
